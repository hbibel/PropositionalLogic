# PropositionalLogic
This is my solution for the 3rd practical assignment for the class 'Techniques in AI'. 
To run the tasks given on the sheet, run `python Test.py`. I tested it in Python 2.7 on a computer running Ubuntu 15.10.
There also is a file `Main.py` which can be used to check whether a formula is a tautology and/or satisfiable (not asked for on the problem sheet).
